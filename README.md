# TShift Challenge

This project was a small challenge proposed by TShift - React code test

## Task Description: 
In our real TShift frontend application we have an "All locations" page where we display all the locations where company users are located. This task is designed to be a simple version of a real page we use and to give you a feeling of what your job will look like in TShift. On the other hand we will be able to check how you handle a real requirement. This is the simplified "All locations" page:
    
    ![All locations](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50903242/109963912-40221180-7ced-11eb-9bf4-befe6595a1b1.png)

Implement small react application that will display "All locations" page. Clicking on a specific location should display a modal with all the properties of that single location. Modal should be closable.

Locations on main "All locations" page are displayed with a card showing some of the location properties. Every location card should also contain a section "Views:", displaying the real number next to it. Default starting value is 0. Every time the user clicks on a location to display its properties, number of views should increase by 1.
